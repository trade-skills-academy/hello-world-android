# Hello World Android

This project will show you how the basics of Android application development works. In order to run this app you need to install Android Studio, and then open the root of this project within Android. If you want to run it on your own device you will need to enable developer options. This method will vary based on your phone, so you will need to consult google on how to do this. Once you have developer options enabled, and your phone connected to your computer, you will be able to run the app directly onto your device.

All source files have been thoroughly commented, so take sometime to read through how everything works.
